# MRT-or-Taxi-Singapore-Transports
This deck of slides provides a complete overview of what my project is about. The project mainly shows my web app using Dash libraries. The data sources are taken from data.gov.sg, dataAPI and some where from Twitter API, Here.com API and Mapbox API. The slides will give better explanation of what the project is about and what ideas I wish for users to take note of. Please find my slides here: [Presentation: “ MRT Taxi Secrets”](https://github.com/cjy93/MRT-or-Taxi-Singapore-Transports/blob/master/P7337992%20MRT%20Taxi%20Secrets.pptx) .

Because i only have a local database and no online database , I can only record the gifs and show you below:
